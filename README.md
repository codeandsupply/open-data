# Code & Supply Open Data Sources

This is a list of known data sources, with a special appreciation for data sources about the Pittsburgh region.

## WPRDC

While not officially endorsed or affiliated with the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center, an idealistic view of this repo is as a potential list to be implemented in the WPRDC Portal located at [http://www.wprdc.org](http://www.wprdc.org).

## Benchmarks

- Number of new data sources added to [http://www.wprdc.org](http://www.wprdc.org)
- Grading according to [http://campusdata.org/rankings/](http://campusdata.org/rankings/) for local universities
- Real life problems solved using listed data sources. Similar to how [Civic Tech Issue Finder](http://www.codeforamerica.org/geeks/civicissues) operates.
